# Market Capitalization Prediction for US Tech Companies

This project aims to analyze and predict the market capitalization of top US tech companies using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project contains information about the top 50 US tech companies, including their annual revenue, employee size, sector, headquarters location, founding year, and more.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform extensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between different features and market capitalization.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for modeling.

3. **Data Visualization**: Create informative visualizations, such as scatter plots and bar charts, to visually represent the relationships between variables and market capitalization.

4. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, to predict the market capitalization based on features like annual revenue and employee size.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (coefficient of determination).

6. **Prediction**: Make predictions on hypothetical new companies by simulating scenarios with different annual revenue and employee size values, showcasing the practical application of the trained models.
